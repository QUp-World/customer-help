<h1>How to rate my driver</h1>

At the end of each ride, you have an option in the app to rate your driver from one to five stars. Your rating should be based on your ride experience and satisfaction throughout the ride. When rating, you can think about if your driver was helpful, friendly, safe, an expert navigator, etc.
- If a 5-stars rating is selected, it means your ride was great and met our standards.
- If you choose lower than 5 stars, it indicates something made you unhappy with the ride so we would like to hear your feedback. Leave your feedback in the comment box to help us understand why that was chosen.

Please note at the moment, your rating cannot be changed after you submit.
<br>
Your rating will help contribute to the driver's overall rating, which you can see when he accepted your ride.
We will use your rating to assess and maintain drivers' quality as well as keep track of customer's satisfaction. As we would hardly respond to your ride feedback submission, please submit your support request {{fleetSupportemail}} if you have requests that need our attention.
